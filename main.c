/* 
PROJECT INFORMATIONS :
This is a side project of my current projet of creating a full
tui app without any other library than the standard one's in C.

The main goal of this side project is to create a sort of
esoteric programming language, turing complete, of my own...

PS (1) : this is a even bader idea than the my previous goal of 
creating a brainfuck interpreter.
PS (2) : "Cerebri Igni" mean "Brain in fire" in Latin. This is
just the code name of my project. 

TODO :
- All

OTHER INFORMATIONS :
compile : gcc main.c -o cerebri
run     : ./cerebri

    printf("Cerebri Igni!\n");
    return 0;
