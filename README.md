# Conway Game of Life
Nothing fancy, I just program in C with ncurses the famous Conway's game.

## Current state of the project :
For now, there is no customisation unless you go in the program and re-compile. I want to add soon a way to load a save, and for exemple load a template with a Gosper's glider gun. I will also add a way to modify the size of the "game universe", for now this is a 128*32 "universe".

## How to play ? :
You need to have a terminal that support color, else you will have an error message. You should not have any problem under linux, for windows I do recommand to use powershell. For mac user I don't know, try to run the linux version, else compile it yourself.
